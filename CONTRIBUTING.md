### 3. Create a New Branch
It's a good practice to create a new branch for your changes to keep your work organized and separate from the main codebase:

```bash
git checkout -b your-branch-name

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Describe your changes here"
```

```bash
git push origin your-branch-name
```
### 7. Open a Pull Request
Go to the original repository on GitHub and open a pull request. Provide a clear description of what you’ve done and why it should be merged.

### 8. Review Process
Once your pull request is submitted, it will be reviewed by other contributors or the repository maintainers. They might request changes or ask questions, so be sure to check back on your pull request.
