This software lets you send viewers to your Twitch live stream without the need for a paid proxy. It uses Selenium to automate the process, connecting to proxy sites, entering your channel name. 
This way, you can boost your viewer count through proxies at no cost.

The concept is straightforward: the software uses blockway, a proxy website that connects to your desired site through proxies. Selenium automates this process, making it easy for you to direct viewers to your stream.

***⚠️ Important: It's recommended to run this software not on computer you’re streaming from or on a machine with plenty of RAM, as it opens many hidden tabs in the background to generate the viewers.***
