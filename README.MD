* This software lets you send viewers to your Twitch live stream without the need for a paid proxy. It uses Selenium to automate the process, connecting to proxy sites, entering your channel name. <br>This way, you can boost your viewer count through proxies at no cost.

* The concept is straightforward: the software uses blockway, a proxy website that connects to your desired site through proxies. Selenium automates this process, making it easy for you to direct viewers to your stream.

> ***‚ö†Ô∏è Important: It's recommended to run this software not on computer you‚Äôre streaming from or on a machine with plenty of RAM, as it opens many hidden tabs in the background to generate the viewers.***

## üì• USAGE
